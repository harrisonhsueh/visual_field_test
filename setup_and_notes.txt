From ECE637 Lab for my Samsung NU7100 40" TV

Backlight = 35/50 (personal
Sharpness = 10 (personal default)
Initially set Contrast (Picture) to 25/50
Brightness (Black) = -2 in range [-5 5] for black to look blackest
Increase Contrast to 35/50 for comfortable brightness

Gray Level = 154
Gamma = 1.37

I changed contrast to 50/50 for this test and general use.
It looks like in this setting, the 50/50 checkers look a bit darker...
so maybe gray level would be lower than 154, and gamma is less than 1.37, but we will keep as is for now.


Can skip testing for false negatives, such as in SITA FASTER
